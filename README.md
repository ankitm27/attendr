# Attendr
Attendr was created as part of the Facebook 2017 Hackathon in Tel-Aviv, Israel.

As meetup organizers, we are all too familiar with the issue of people hitting the "attending" button simply as a means of reminding them of the event, regardless of their intent of actually showing up.

Our goal is to allow event organizers to better anticipate the number of people who will actually arrive.
